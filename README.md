# Interview SPX

> [!TIP]
> Candidate should read that README carefully before the interview. The setup shouldn't take you more than 15min of preparation before the interview.

## 1. Introduction
This repository contains the code for the interview assignment. The idea is to be close to a real project
and to evaluate the candidate's skills in software development, problem-solving, and software design.

As you'll see this code is not perfect, and there are some issues that need to be fixed. You don't have to write any code before the interview, this is not an home assignement. However if you encounter some improvements you think are necessary feel free to write them down before the interview, so that they can start the conversation.

This repository is divided into two parts:

- backend: A NestJS application that provides an API to query OpenAI.
- frontend: A React application that provides a user interface to interact with the backend.

## 2. Installation
To install the backend and frontend applications, follow the instructions in the respective directories.

You will need an OpenAI API key to run the backend application. 
- We will provide a temporary API key for testing purposes during the interview.
- The API key should be stored in an environment variable called `OPENAI_API_KEY`. (or the .env file in the backend directory)
- If your are not using the .env file, you should also set environment variables `OPEN_AI_MODEL_VERSION` to `GPT-4o` and `OPEN_AI_CLIENT_ID` to `test`

  ```
  cd backend/
  npm install
  npm run start

  cd ../frontend
  npm install
  npm run start
  ```

## 3. Running the Applications
To run the backend and frontend applications, follow the instructions in the respective directories.
Rq: by default, the backend runs on port 3000 and the frontend runs on port 3001.

```
npm run start
```

## 4. Assignment

> [!CAUTION]
> Please make sure you do the Task 1 before the interview.

### Task 1 - Before the interview
Make sure you can run the applications locally on your laptop, and understand the code. The idea is to not lose time on setup during the interview.
If you need help look at the code from [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create)

### Task 2. During the interview
We will communicate this task during the interview.

**Example of task**
Can you allow the user to change the openai model used to generate the completion.
There is already an input form for that value in the frontend in App.tsx, but it is not being used in the backend in app.controller.ts
You can find the available models in the OpenAI API documentation [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create).
